# C++ Project Skeleton

This is a minimal, build-ready C++ project scaffold using CMake. It includes a clean directory layout and a built-in CLI tool (`gold`) to streamline setup, building, and execution.

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Recommended)

Use the included `gold` CLI to set up, build, and run your project.

1. Run setup:
   ```bash
   gold setup
   ```
   This will:

   - Prompt for your project name
   - Replace `PROJECT_NAME` in all `CMakeLists.txt` files
   - Build the project
   - Set up global access to `gold` via `~/.local/bin`

2. Run your project:
   ```bash
   gold run
   ```
   This will rebuild the project and run your compiled binary.

For more info, see the `gold` tool README:

## ðŸ”§ Manual Build (Optional)

If you prefer to build manually:

1. Replace all instances of `PROJECT_NAME` with your actual project name.
2. Create and enter a build directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
3. Configure and build:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   ```
4. Run your binary:
   ```bash
   ./bin/{PROJECT_NAME}
   ```
